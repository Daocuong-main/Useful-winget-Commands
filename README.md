`winget upgrade --all` is a command in the Windows Package Manager (`winget`) that updates all installed packages to their latest versions. Despite its utility, it may be less popular due to the relatively recent introduction of `winget` and the prevalence of alternative package managers like Chocolatey.

Here are some other useful but lesser-known `winget` commands:

1. **Search for Packages by Tag**:
   To find packages associated with a specific tag, use:
   ```powershell
   winget search --tag <tag>
   ```
   Replace `<tag>` with the desired keyword. For example, to search for packages related to "security":
   ```powershell
   winget search --tag security
   ```


2. **Install a Specific Version of a Package**:
   To install a particular version of a package, specify the version number:
   ```powershell
   winget install <package> --version <version>
   ```
   For example, to install version 1.2.3 of "example-package":
   ```powershell
   winget install example-package --version 1.2.3
   ```


3. **Export Installed Packages to a JSON File**:
   To create a backup of your installed packages:
   ```powershell
   winget export -o packages.json
   ```
   This command saves the list to `packages.json`. You can later use this file to restore or replicate your setup.

4. **Import Packages from a JSON File**:
   To install packages listed in a JSON file:
   ```powershell
   winget import -i packages.json
   ```
   Ensure `packages.json` contains the desired package list.

5. **Show Package Details**:
   To view detailed information about a package:
   ```powershell
   winget show <package>
   ```
   For example:
   ```powershell
   winget show example-package
   ```


6. **Uninstall a Package**:
   To remove an installed package:
   ```powershell
   winget uninstall <package>
   ```
   For example:
   ```powershell
   winget uninstall example-package
   ```


7. **List Installed Packages**:
   To display all installed packages:
   ```powershell
   winget list
   ```


8. **Validate Package Manifests**:
   To check the validity of a package manifest file:
   ```powershell
   winget validate <manifest>
   ```
   Replace `<manifest>` with the path to your manifest file.

These commands enhance the functionality of `winget`, making it a powerful tool for managing software on Windows.
